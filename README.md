Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. // This is created using JS
The input should be between O and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: // This is created using HTML
A
AÂ» 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40. // Using JS, one can apply the if-else conditional
statement and apply DOM to bring the feedback on the browser for client

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. I/ This is created using HTML
If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". // If-else statement is applied.
Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the
total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2".
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended"
